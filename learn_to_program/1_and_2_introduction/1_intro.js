/*

I actually start this course by writing my notes in evernote (and not in an IDE).

My notes from chapters 1 and 2:

1. Javascript:

- When people say "the program is "running" on your computer" = the computer is carrying out your instructions (which
    are written in e.g. javascript).
- JS runs in the browser and can also runs outside a web browser.
- In this course, we will be writing programs in javascript and will then run them inside another program, node.js.

2. Installing node

- Download and install from the node.js website.
- Once downloaded, I can run node in my terminal. Just type ```node```. Then e.g. ```2+2```. 4 will appear.
- What is Node REPL = basically the node command line (read, evaluate, print, loop).
- When running node in the REPL, you can also type .help to see some non-javascript commands that the repl will understand

3. Running a javascript file with node REPL

Example file is called program.js

```node program.js```

4. Syntax.

- Semi colons are optional in javascript. But it’s good to get into the habit of using them…
- It’s a case sensitive language (Lunch and lunch)
