/*

If I launch the REPL and type the name of an object, it gives me a list of functions and information relating to that object. Pretty cool

e.g. console objec
e.g. process object

If I type e.g. console.log (without the function brackets), the REPL will tell me that log is a function.

But if I type process.title, title being a 'property' of the process object, it will simply print out the title (i.e. it gets the title).
You can also 'set' a property using the REPL
e.g. process.title = 'hi there';
